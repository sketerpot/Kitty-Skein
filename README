Kitty Skein
===========

Kitty Skein is a small, simple library implementing the Skein hash and
the Threefish tweakable block cipher.

Installation
============

You need scons to build it. Once you have scons, just type

$ scons
$ sudo scons install

Speed
=====

Threefish-512 encrypts at 520 MB/s on a Xeon X5550, in CBC mode. For
comparison, AES-128 only gets 97 MB/s on the same processor.
Threefish-512 is 5.36 times faster! Incidentally, this is about
the same speed claimed in the NIST submission document.

Decryption of Threefish-512 is approximately 89% as fast as
encryption. If you want the maximum speed possible, you may want to
consider using a chaining mode that relies only on encryption, such as
CTR mode.
